# 🧬 Quantum Teleportation with PennyLane

This repository contains a complete implementation of **quantum teleportation** using [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai/), a Python library for quantum machine learning and quantum computing.

## 📌 About the Project

Quantum teleportation is a fundamental protocol in quantum information theory. It allows the transfer of an **unknown quantum state** from one qubit (Alice's) to another distant qubit (Bob's), using:

- Quantum entanglement
- Classical communication
- Measurement and correction operations

This notebook walks through each step of the protocol with interactive code and explanations.
